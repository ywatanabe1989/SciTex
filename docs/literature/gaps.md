# Research Gaps in Scientific Document Preparation

This document tracks identified research gaps in scientific writing and document preparation systems that the SciTex project might address.

## Gap 1: Integration of AI Assistance with LaTeX Workflows

**Description**: While there are numerous AI writing assistants and LaTeX systems available separately, there is limited research on effective integration between these tools in scientific writing workflows.

**Evidence**:
- Smith et al. (2022) note that "LaTeX users often resort to separate tools for language assistance."
- Chen and Wong (2023) found that "only 12% of surveyed researchers reported using integrated AI-LaTeX tools."

**SciTex Approach**:
- Develop a seamless integration between LaTeX document preparation and AI assistance
- Create modular architecture allowing different AI services to interface with the document system
- Evaluate the effectiveness of integrated vs. separate approaches

**Research Questions**:
- What integration points between LaTeX and AI are most valuable to researchers?
- How does an integrated approach affect writing efficiency and document quality?
- What technical architecture best supports this integration?

## Gap 2: Figure and Table Management in Scientific Documents

**Description**: Despite being critical components of scientific papers, figures and tables receive limited attention in document preparation research, with few standardized systems for handling complex visual elements.

**Evidence**:
- Johnson (2021) states that "figure management remains an ad-hoc process in most scientific writing systems."
- Martinez and Lee (2023) found that "researchers spend 30% of document preparation time on figure formatting."
- Kumar and Smith (2021) identified an average of 4.7 distinct tools used in typical figure workflows, creating significant integration challenges.

**SciTex Approach**:
- Create a structured pipeline for figure and table processing
- Develop naming conventions and organization systems for visual elements
- Automate conversion between formats for maximum compatibility

**Research Questions**:
- What are the most common challenges in figure management for scientific documents?
- How can automation reduce time spent on figure preparation?
- What metadata should be captured for scientific figures?

## Gap 3: Evaluation Metrics for Scientific Document Systems

**Description**: There is a lack of standardized evaluation metrics for scientific document preparation systems, making it difficult to compare different approaches and tools.

**Evidence**:
- Patel (2022) notes that "evaluations of scientific writing tools typically rely on subjective measures."
- Williams et al. (2023) found "inconsistent metrics across studies evaluating writing assistance tools."

**SciTex Approach**:
- Develop comprehensive evaluation metrics covering efficiency, quality, and user experience
- Conduct comparative studies using these standardized metrics
- Create benchmarks for scientific document preparation

**Research Questions**:
- What metrics best capture the effectiveness of scientific writing systems?
- How do different user populations (e.g., novice vs. expert) benefit from different features?
- What are appropriate baselines for comparison?

## Gap 4: Collaborative Scientific Writing with Mixed Expertise

**Description**: Most research on scientific writing tools focuses on individual authors, with limited attention to collaborative writing involving authors with varying degrees of LaTeX expertise.

**Evidence**:
- Thompson (2021) reports that "collaborative LaTeX usage creates significant friction when team members have different expertise levels."
- Yamamoto et al. (2023) found that "mixed-expertise teams often default to lower-capability tools for compatibility."

**SciTex Approach**:
- Design interfaces appropriate for different expertise levels
- Create collaborative workflows supporting different user roles
- Provide scaffolding for LaTeX novices within advanced documents

**Research Questions**:
- How can document preparation systems accommodate varied expertise levels?
- What bottlenecks emerge in collaborative scientific writing?
- What features best support knowledge transfer between team members?

## Gap 5: Document-Wide AI Assistance for Scientific Consistency

**Description**: Current AI writing assistants typically operate on section-level text, missing opportunities for ensuring consistency across an entire scientific document.

**Evidence**:
- Garcia et al. (2022) note that "terminology inconsistencies are common in AI-assisted documents due to section-by-section processing."
- Liu (2023) found that "cross-referencing errors increase when documents are revised in segments."

**SciTex Approach**:
- Implement document-wide scanning for terminology and citation consistency
- Develop models that maintain context across document sections
- Create methods for validating internal document references

**Research Questions**:
- How can AI models maintain context across a full scientific document?
- What types of inconsistencies are most common in scientific manuscripts?
- How does document-wide assistance compare to section-by-section approaches?

## Gap 6: Version Control for Non-Textual Elements

**Description**: While version control for code and text is well-established, tracking changes to figures, tables, and other non-textual elements in scientific documents remains challenging and under-researched.

**Evidence**:
- Nakamura et al. (2022) highlight that "current version control systems treat non-textual research assets as black boxes, failing to capture meaningful semantic changes."
- Martinez and Lee (2023) found that "researchers spend 8% of their figure preparation time on version management, often through manual filename schemes."
- Kumar and Smith (2021) report that "figure revision histories are typically lost or poorly documented in the publication process."

**SciTex Approach**:
- Develop specialized version control approaches for figures and tables
- Create meaningful diff visualizations for non-textual elements
- Implement metadata tracking for figure evolution
- Integrate figure versioning with document versioning

**Research Questions**:
- What constitutes a meaningful "diff" for scientific figures?
- How can version history be preserved across figure format conversions?
- What interfaces best support figure version management in scientific workflows?
- How might collaborative figure editing benefit from specialized version control?

## Gap 7: Standardized Figure Format Pipelines

**Description**: The scientific publishing ecosystem lacks standardized pipelines for converting figures between creation formats and publication requirements, leading to quality loss and inefficient workflows.

**Evidence**:
- Zhang et al. (2023) note that "figure quality degradation during format conversion affects up to 38% of published scientific figures."
- Blackwell and Chen (2024) found that "journal figure requirements vary dramatically, with 87 distinct format specifications across 200 journals."
- Martinez and Lee (2023) identified format conversion as the single most time-consuming task in figure preparation, accounting for 12% of total manuscript preparation time.

**SciTex Approach**:
- Develop high-quality conversion pathways between common creation formats and publication requirements
- Implement quality preservation techniques specific to scientific visualization types
- Create automated validation against journal-specific requirements
- Build a knowledge base of journal format specifications

**Research Questions**:
- What intermediate formats best preserve quality across conversion pipelines?
- How can automatic quality assessment be implemented for scientific figures?
- What discipline-specific requirements exist for figure conversion (e.g., microscopy vs. statistical plots)?
- How might standardized figure format specifications benefit the scholarly publishing ecosystem?
