# SciTex Project Progress

## Overall Progress: 95%

This document tracks the progress of the SciTex project's development.

## Repository Structure and Analysis: 100%

- [x] Identified SciTex as an AI-assisted LaTeX template for scientific manuscripts
- [x] Understood the three main components: manuscript, revision, and supplementary
- [x] Analyzed the Python scripts for AI integration
- [x] Reviewed bash scripts for compilation and automation

## Core Features: 100%

- [x] LaTeX template compliant with Elsevier guidelines but adaptable to other journals
- [x] AI-powered text revision using GPT models
- [x] Citation insertion assistance
- [x] Term checking for consistency
- [x] PowerPoint to TIF conversion utilities
- [x] Version management system

## Compilation Process: 100%

- [x] Main entry point via `compile` script with various flags
- [x] Modular architecture with specialized task modules
- [x] Pipeline flow: validation → revision → figure processing → compilation → diff generation → versioning

## LaTeX Structure: 100%

- [x] Main document (`main.tex`) as entry point including all components
- [x] Modular organization of content into separate section files
- [x] Style management through dedicated style files

## Workflow: 100%

- [x] Content creation in individual `.tex` files
- [x] Figure preparation (including PowerPoint conversion)
- [x] Table preparation
- [x] AI-assisted revision and citation
- [x] Automated versioning and diff tracking

## Codebase Refactoring: 100%

- [x] Created `config.py` for centralized settings and constants
- [x] Implemented improved `GPTClient` class with better error handling
- [x] Created `file_utils.py` for file operations
- [x] Extracted prompts to template files
- [x] Implemented proper CLI with argparse
- [x] Updated all scripts to use new modules
- [x] Added type hints to functions
- [x] Created unified `scitex.py` script as main entry point

## Testing Implementation: 100%

- [x] Created test directory structure
  - [x] Unit tests directory
  - [x] Integration tests directory
  - [x] Test fixtures and sample data
- [x] Implemented unit tests

  - [x] Mock tests for gpt_client.py
- [x] Implemented integration tests for main workflows
- [x] Created test runner scripts
  - [x] Python test runner (run_tests.py)
  - [x] Bash test runner (run_tests.sh)
- [x] Added test documentation

## Documentation: 100%

- [x] Created LLM usage guide (LLM_USAGE.md)
