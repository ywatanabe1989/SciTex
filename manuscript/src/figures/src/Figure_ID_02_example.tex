\caption{\textbf{
Comparison of manuscript preparation time with and without SciTex
}
\smallskip
\\
Bar chart comparing the time required for manuscript preparation across different academic disciplines when using traditional methods versus the SciTex system. Data was collected from a survey of 50 researchers across multiple institutions. Error bars represent standard deviation. The SciTex system demonstrates significant time savings across all disciplines, with the greatest improvements observed in fields requiring complex figure preparation and extensive referencing.
