% Example abstract demonstrating SciTex features

Scientific manuscripts require careful structure and formatting to effectively communicate research findings. This example manuscript demonstrates the SciTex system, an AI-assisted LaTeX template for scientific writing. We showcase key features including modular document organization, figure and table handling, and integration with GPT models for text revision and citation management. The template follows best practices for scientific writing while demonstrating how artificial intelligence can enhance the writing process. Our methodology includes structured LaTeX components, automated processing scripts, and intelligent text analysis. Results show significant improvements in document preparation efficiency and consistency. This template serves as both a demonstration and a starting point for researchers preparing their own scientific manuscripts.
