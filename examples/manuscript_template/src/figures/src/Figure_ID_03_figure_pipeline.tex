\\
The figure shows the complete processing pipeline for figures in SciTex. Starting from diverse input formats (PowerPoint, image files, or data visualizations), the system processes figures through multiple stages including format conversion, resolution adjustment, caption integration, and final inclusion in the document. Each node represents a processing step, with sample outputs shown alongside the workflow.
